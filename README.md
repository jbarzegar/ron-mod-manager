This is a mod manager for ready or not to manage .pak files


This is not intended for public use, since I'm using this as a way to learn how to write go. If you have trouble with it I'm sorry I will not help you. Since this is not in a stable state where it's intended to be used by anyone aside from myself (yet? Maybe ever who knows) 


If you use this, and you run into issues you're on your own for now.
